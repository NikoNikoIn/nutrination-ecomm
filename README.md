# About

This is an e-commerce project made on Python\Django\REST for back-end and React\Axios\Redux\Bootstrap for front-end

## Used in the project:

Python, Django, REST, React, Axios, Redux, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PostgreSQL

## Functionality:

My website is an online store selling sports nutrition supplements called NutriNation. I use ReactJS, Bootstrap, Axios and Redux for the frontend, Django and Django REST Framework for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database, which is hosted on neon.tech. I also use Firebase to store images, JavaScript scripts and CSS styles. My website is hosted on vercel.com for fast and reliable content delivery. 
 
I have registration and login functionality and a product list that supports filtering by availability, creation date. Top products component shows top products with high rating and availability. There is a search system by product name, categories and brands. 
 
The product page displays basic information as well as the ability to add the product to the cart with the quantity. Users can leave and view reviews (one review per product per account) and view similar products (filtering by category). I also added the ability to add discounts to products through the admin panel. 
 
Shopping cart system using localstorage, and I also provide the ability to specify shipping address (also stored in localstorage) and select payment method (PayPal or cash). At checkout, the user sees basic information and prices, including total cost, shipping, taxes and discounts through promo codes. 
 
After creating an order, the user is redirected to a unique order page where they can make payment via a PayPal Sandbox account. In the navigation bar, there is a "Profile" tab where the user can view their information (change password/email/name, delete account, view their orders) or log out of the account. In the navigation bar there is also a "Categories" tab, which contains all the categories of products (dynamically added: if you add a product with a new category, it is automatically added to this tab). There is also an "About us" tab with information about the company. 
 
In the footer of the page, there are links to the shopping cart, profile, and my GitHub.  
 
Admins have access to an additional "Admin" tab where they can manage users, products, orders, and promo codes. They can also change the details of products, users, and promo codes, as well as delete reviews and mark orders as shipped or paid. 
 
My Site is also optimized for mobile devices, ensuring it is usable on any device.
